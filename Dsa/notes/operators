{ Operators in C++ }

Operators are symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical, logical, or manipulative operations on variables and values. 

Here’s a breakdown of the various types of operators in C++:

1. Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform basic arithmetic operations.

    + (Addition): Adds two operands.
    - (Subtraction): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
    * (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands.
    / (Division): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
    % (Modulus): Returns the remainder of division.

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators

These operators compare two values and return true or false.

    == (Equal to): Checks if two operands are equal.
    != (Not equal to): Checks if two operands are not equal.
    > (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
    < (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
    >= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
    <= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

3. Logical Operators

These operators are used for logical operations and typically return a boolean value.

    && (Logical AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
    || (Logical OR): Returns true if one of the operands is true.
    ! (Logical NOT): Returns true if the operand is false.

4. Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators operate on binary numbers directly, manipulating the individual bits.

    & (Bitwise AND): Performs a binary AND on two bits.
    | (Bitwise OR): Performs a binary OR on two bits.
    ^ (Bitwise XOR): Performs a binary XOR (exclusive OR) on two bits.
    ~ (Bitwise NOT): Flips all the bits in a number.
    << (Left Shift): Shifts bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
    >> (Right Shift): Shifts bits to the right by a specified number of positions.

Example:

cpp

int x = 5;  // Binary: 0101
int y = 3;  // Binary: 0011
int result = x & y;  // Result: 0001 (1 in decimal)

5. Assignment Operators

These operators assign values to variables.

    = (Assignment): Assigns the right operand to the left operand.
    += (Add and assign): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
    -= (Subtract and assign): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result.
    *= (Multiply and assign): Multiplies the operands and assigns the result.
    /= (Divide and assign): Divides the operands and assigns the result.
    %= (Modulus and assign): Finds modulus and assigns the result.

6. Increment and Decrement Operators

These are shorthand operators to increase or decrease a value by 1.

    ++ (Increment): Increases a value by 1.
        ++i (Pre-increment): Increments first, then uses the variable.
        i++ (Post-increment): Uses the variable first, then increments.
    -- (Decrement): Decreases a value by 1.
        --i (Pre-decrement).
        i-- (Post-decrement).

7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand for an if-else statement.

    ?: (Ternary): condition ? expr1 : expr2
        If the condition is true, it evaluates and returns expr1, otherwise expr2.

Example:

cpp

int x = 10;
int y = (x > 5) ? 1 : 0;  // y will be 1 because x > 5 is true.

8. Typecast Operator

This is used to convert a variable from one type to another.

    type(value): Converts the value to the specified type.

9. Pointer Operators

    & (Address of): Returns the address of a variable.
    * (Dereference): Accesses the value stored at a particular address.

10. Scope Resolution Operator (::)

This operator is used to define the context in which a variable or method is defined.

    Classname::method(): Specifies that the method belongs to the given class.

Detailed Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operations work on binary representations of numbers. Here’s a more detailed look:
Bitwise AND (&)

    Operation: Takes two binary numbers and compares them bit by bit. The result will have a 1 only where both bits in the corresponding position are 1.
        Example: 1010 & 0110 = 0010.

Bitwise OR (|)

    Operation: Takes two binary numbers and compares them bit by bit. The result will have a 1 where either or both bits are 1.
        Example: 1010 | 0110 = 1110.

Bitwise XOR (^)

    Operation: Takes two binary numbers and returns a 1 where the bits differ , if the bits are same then it returns 0.
        Example: 1010 ^ 0110 = 1100.

Bitwise NOT (~)

    Operation: Flips all the bits in the number. 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0.
        Example: ~1010 = 0101 (inverting all bits).

Left Shift (<<)

    Operation: Shifts all bits in a binary number to the left by a specified number of positions, effectively multiplying the number by powers of two.
        Example: 1010 << 2 = 101000 (Shifts two bits left, adding two zeros at the end).

Right Shift (>>)

    Operation: Shifts all bits in a binary number to the right by a specified number of positions, effectively dividing the number by powers of two.
        Example: 1010 >> 2 = 0010 (Shifts two bits right).

Conclusion

Learning about operators and their properties is essential for optimizing and writing efficient C++ code. Bitwise operations are particularly useful when dealing with low-level data manipulation, such as in embedded systems, graphics, and cryptography. Keep practicing these operators to develop a deeper understanding.
