[ Two Dimentional Array ] -> ONE SHOT 


2D Array
=> A 2D array is an array of arrays. It is used to store data in a tabular format (like a matrix). In memory, it is stored row by row (row-major order).

Characteristics:
=> Rows and Columns: A 2D array has two dimensions, typically accessed using two indices—arr[i][j].
=> Fixed Size: Like 1D arrays, the size of a 2D array is fixed once declared.

Syntax in C++:
int arr[3][4] = {
    {1, 2, 3, 4}, 
    {5, 6, 7, 8}, 
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};  // A 3x4 matrix

Time Complexity:

    Accessing an element: O(1)
    Searching, Insertion, Deletion: O(n*m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.


VECTOR OF VECTORS :: 

A 2D vector is essentially a vector of vectors. It is a dynamic structure that allows you to store rows of data, where each row itself is a vector. This makes it highly flexible for caseswhere the number of rows or columns is not fixed.

std::vector<std::vector<int>> vec;

Initialization Examples ::

Empty 2D Vector:

std::vector<std::vector<int>> vec;

Fixed Size with Default Values:

int rows = 3, cols = 4, defaultValue = 0;
std::vector<std::vector<int>> vec(rows, std::vector<int>(cols, defaultValue));

Direct Initialization:

std::vector<std::vector<int>> vec = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};


Accessing Elements

vec[i][j]; // Access element at row `i` and column `j`

Number of Rows:

int rows = vec.size();

Number of Columns (in a specific row):

int cols = vec[0].size(); // Assuming the vector is not empty



Getting Rows and Columns from a 2D Array ::

If you are using a 2D array:

int arr[3][4]; // 3 rows and 4 columns

    Number of Rows:

int rows = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

Number of Columns:

int cols = sizeof(arr[0]) / sizeof(arr[0][0]);


One-Shot for 2D Array Formulas ::

Variables Used:

    i: Row index (0-based).
    j: Column index (0-based).
    rows: Total number of rows in the 2D array.
    cols: Total number of columns in the 2D array.
    Base_Address: Memory address of the first element (arr[0][0]).
    sizeof(type): Size of each element in bytes.

1. Row-Major Order

    Memory Address Formula:

    Address(arr[i][j]) = Base_Address + (i * cols + j) * sizeof(type)

    Mapping to 1D Index:

    index_in_1D = i * cols + j

2. Column-Major Order

    Memory Address Formula:

    Address(arr[i][j]) = Base_Address + (j * rows + i) * sizeof(type)

    Mapping to 1D Index:

      index_in_1D = j * rows + i

3. Total Elements in a 2D Array

    Formula:

    Total Elements = rows * cols

4. Calculate Row and Column from a 1D Index (Row-Major Order)

    Given a 1D index index_in_1D:

    Row:

    i = index_in_1D / cols

    Column:

    j = index_in_1D % cols

5. Calculate Row and Column from a 1D Index (Column-Major Order)

    Given a 1D index index_in_1D:

    Column:

    j = index_in_1D / rows

    Row:

    i = index_in_1D % rows

6. Total Memory Used by a 2D Array

    Formula:

    Total Memory = rows * cols * sizeof(type)

7. Sum of All Elements in a 2D Array

    Formula:

    Sum = Σ(arr[i][j]) for all i and j

8. Accessing the Main Diagonal

    Condition for Diagonal Elements:

    i == j

9. Accessing the Anti-Diagonal

    Condition for Anti-Diagonal Elements:

    i + j == cols - 1

10. Boundary Elements

    Condition for Boundary Elements:

    i == 0 || i == rows - 1 || j == 0 || j == cols - 1

Usage

These formulas can be applied to various problems like matrix traversal, memory optimization, and index calculations.
