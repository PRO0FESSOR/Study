[ ONE SHOT ]


[ BACKEND ]

- In tech, backend refers to the server-side of an application that handles logic, databases, authentication, and communication with the frontend. It processes requests, executes business logic, and manages data storage.
- Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies web development by providing built-in features like authentication, database management, and security.
- Django features MVC/MVT architecture, a built-in admin panel, ORM for database interaction, robust security (protecting against SQL injection, CSRF, XSS), and high scalability (used by Instagram, Pinterest).

- MVC stands for Model–View–Controller, a software design pattern used to separate concerns in web applications.
- MVT is Django’s design pattern, a variation of MVC tailored for web development.
- Model handles the data: defines database structure, fields, and relationships.
- View contains business logic: processes requests, queries models, and returns responses.
- Template is the presentation layer: defines how data is displayed (HTML, CSS).
- Unlike MVC, Django’s framework itself acts as the Controller (URL dispatcher).
- Views in Django are Python functions/classes that link models and templates.
- Templates use Django Template Language (DTL) to dynamically generate HTML.
- Models are defined in models.py, and automatically linked to the database.
- Views are in views.py, and they fetch data from models and render templates.
- MVT ensures separation of concerns, making Django apps modular, maintainable, and scalable.

- Initialy we can create a project and create app for the project.
- Project is the single entity but app can be multiple and will be used for each feature.
- After creating a app we have to add it in installed apps in settings.py.
- VIEWS in django
- Views handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.
- They contain the logic for what happens when a user visits a specific URL.
- Views can be written as Function-Based Views (FBVs) or Class-Based Views (CBVs).
- Function-Based Views (FBV)
- Regular Python functions that take request as an argument.
- So python function takes request variable as an argument.
- We can simply define a function for view , then we can write logic in function and then we can return it.
- We can returnn HttpResponse just to get simple response.
- We can return render which can be use to render html or template , syntax is render(request,'a.html').
- We can return jsonresponse to return a json.
- We can also return redirect for redirecting to another url.
- We can import render or redirect from the django.shortcuts.
- We can import httpresponse , jsonresponse or httpresponsenotfound from django.http.
- We can use decorator (funcions to increase functionality of other function) like @require_http_methods to use differnt http method like @require_http_methods(["POST"]).
- We can import @require_http_method from django.views.decorators.http
- Common decorators:
    @require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
    @csrf_exempt
    @login_required (from django.contrib.auth.decorators)
- By default, Django requires CSRF tokens for POST methods.
- Use @csrf_exempt to bypass during testing (not recommended in production).
- We can import @csrf_exempt from django.views.decorators.csrf .
- Class-Based Views (CBV)
- We can also create classes for views just like functions.
- We can simply create a class which take View variable as an argument to initialise a class based view.
- We can import View for class from django.views.
- Inside class we can create a function with the http method name like def get() which take self,request as an argument then we can return it.
- We can use @method_decorators to use decorators in class based view.
- We can import method decorators from django.utils.decorators.
- We can use method decorator like - @method_decorator(csrf_exempt, name='dispatch').
- Organize logic into class methods like .get(), .post(), .put(), etc.
- We can use HttpResponseRedirect – redirects to another URL.
- We can use render(request, template, context) – shortcut to return HTML with context.
- Context is a dictionary passed from view to template.
- It contains data to be dynamically rendered in HTML using template syntax.
- We can also create dynamic views which accepts another value with the request like (request,id) which can be used to modify view.
- Django’s advanced views include TemplateView, ListView, DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView, and Mixins (e.g., LoginRequiredMixin) — all part of Generic Class-Based Views (GCBVs) that simplify common CRUD and page-rendering tasks by providing built-in logic for displaying, creating, updating, deleting, and securing data with minimal code.
- HTTP Method Handling
    You can filter request methods using if request.method == "POST".
    Or restrict methods using @require_http_methods.
    CBVs define get(), post(), put(), delete() methods.
- Error Views
    Custom views can return 404, 403, or other error responses.
    Django can also use custom error handlers: handler404, handler500, etc.
- URLS in django.
- Views include the logic for response but Urls are used to link a view with the url map hello_view with the hello/ url.
- Urls are created inside a urls.py file which exist at project level but we can create same like for app level to organise better.
- Urls.py file consist of the list name as url patterns and inside that list we can define paths.
- We can import path from django.urls.
- This path function simply take some arguments first is url like '' - home pr 'about/' , second is view to map it with url and third is name which is used for the unique identifier.
- We can simply import views inside the urls file like from . import views.
- We can simply use it like views.about_view.
- For urls which use class based views , we have to use .as_view() method to map view with url like - view.about_view.as_view().
- Example of a path - path('template/',views.template_view,name='template').
- We have to design the url for a dynamic view in a differnt way - 'hello/<str:name>/' so first argument in path should be like this means with hello url we are accepting a string value which we will use for name.
- For project level urls - we can put each application level url in project level urls.py.
- Same for project level urls we can define app urls in advance way , we can simply add all applevel views using include.
- We can import include from django.urls just like path.
- We can do it like this - path('',include('learnViews.urls')), #All learnViews URLS.
- Above example works like in a normal way , we can hit url by simply typing it but if we use url in above example instead of '' empty like - 'api2/' so we have to use api2/our view for all the learnViews app.
- Best Practices
    Keep views thin – avoid too much logic in views.
    Delegate database access to models and data formatting to templates.
    Use CBVs when you need reusability and structure.
    Use FBVs when logic is simple or highly customized.
- Templates in Django are HTML files that define how data is presented to users — they use the Django Template Language (DTL) to dynamically insert data (from views) using placeholders like {{ variable }} and logic tags like {% for %} or {% if %}.
- For templates we need to create a templates folder first and then create html files inside it and django will use html files from this folder.
- There are multiple ways to manage templated in django , either we can create all files related to the app inside app only or we can create templates folder inside project level and then create subfolders for each app and then put files accordingly.
- From views and urls we already know how to render a template .
- We have already studied about context for templates , basicallg its a variable which take a dictionary , we can pass this context while returning a template view.
- We can access dictionary variables inside html page or template which this way - {{variable}}.
- DTL (Django Template Language) is Django’s built-in templating system used to dynamically generate HTML pages.
- For using dtl we already know we can access variable from context by {{variable}}
- It is not mandatory but it is recommended to pass one context only and all the data inside it.
- We can use if else in dtl by if and endif tag - { % if age % } {% endif %}.
- Dtl doesnt allow direct use of operator like > < so do calculation in view only.
- We can also use loop in dtl by {% for i in items %} {{i}} {% endfor %}
- We can also use date time by simply importing datetime from datetime and use its function datetime.now().
- In dtl we can use some filters like upper or for date by using - | pipe.
- For example for date - {{dt | date:'D d M Y'}}.
- There are also predefined variables for loop in dtl like forloop.counter , forloop.counter0 , forloop.parentloop .
- Loops for dictionary we can use like for key , value in data.
- Django template filters: upper, lower, title, length, default, join, date, truncatechars, safe, add, dictsort, floatformat, capfirst, cut, slice, wordcount, filesizeformat, yesno, linebreaks, pluralize, urlencode — used to format, transform, or display data dynamically in templates.
- We can create static files in app level or project level to use static data like css or js or image.
- We can do this by simply adding a tag in template - {% load static %}.
- And when we are providing file location in href then also we have to add static tag like this - {% load static %}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">.
- We can also use template inheritance in django means we can extend the functionality of the existing file.
- We can simply inherit the class by extend tag like {% extends 'base.html' %}.
- We can inherit and change the functionality of tags by block and endblock by <title>{% block title %}Templates{% endblock %}</title> so we can use the same block in child file and change the data.
- There is also include tag in the django templates which allow use to simply use or include another template in our file , this allows reusability.
- We can simply do this by - {% include 'included.html' %}.
