[ ONE SHOT ]


[ BACKEND ]

- In tech, backend refers to the server-side of an application that handles logic, databases, authentication, and communication with the frontend. It processes requests, executes business logic, and manages data storage.
- Django is a high-level Python web framework that simplifies web development by providing built-in features like authentication, database management, and security.
- Django features MVC/MVT architecture, a built-in admin panel, ORM for database interaction, robust security (protecting against SQL injection, CSRF, XSS), and high scalability (used by Instagram, Pinterest).

- MVC stands for Model–View–Controller, a software design pattern used to separate concerns in web applications.
- MVT is Django’s design pattern, a variation of MVC tailored for web development.
- Model handles the data: defines database structure, fields, and relationships.
- View contains business logic: processes requests, queries models, and returns responses.
- Template is the presentation layer: defines how data is displayed (HTML, CSS).
- Unlike MVC, Django’s framework itself acts as the Controller (URL dispatcher).
- Views in Django are Python functions/classes that link models and templates.
- Templates use Django Template Language (DTL) to dynamically generate HTML.
- Models are defined in models.py, and automatically linked to the database.
- Views are in views.py, and they fetch data from models and render templates.
- MVT ensures separation of concerns, making Django apps modular, maintainable, and scalable.


- VIEWS

- Views handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.
- They contain the logic for what happens when a user visits a specific URL.
- Views can be written as Function-Based Views (FBVs) or Class-Based Views (CBVs).
- Function-Based Views (FBV)
- Regular Python functions that take request as an argument.
- Return HttpResponse, JsonResponse, HttpResponseRedirect, etc.
- Common decorators:
    @require_http_methods(["GET", "POST"])
    @csrf_exempt
    @login_required (from django.contrib.auth.decorators)
- Class-Based Views (CBV)
- Inherit from django.views.View or other mixins like TemplateView, DetailView, etc.
- Organize logic into class methods like .get(), .post(), .put(), etc.
- Must use .as_view() in urls.py to convert to a callable view.
- Decorators like @method_decorator can be applied to CBVs.
- Return Types
- HttpResponse – returns plain text or HTML.
- JsonResponse – returns JSON (for APIs).
- HttpResponseRedirect – redirects to another URL.
- HttpResponseNotFound, HttpResponseBadRequest, etc., for error responses.
- render(request, template, context) – shortcut to return HTML with context.
- Context in Views
- Context is a dictionary passed from view to template.
- It contains data to be dynamically rendered in HTML using template syntax.
- Dynamic Views
- Can take URL parameters via <int:id>, <str:name> etc.
- These parameters are passed as arguments to the view.
- Advanced CBVs
- TemplateView, ListView, DetailView, CreateView, etc. handle common tasks.
- Mixins can be used for reusable logic (e.g. LoginRequiredMixin).
-  HTTP Method Handling
    You can filter request methods using if request.method == "POST".
    Or restrict methods using @require_http_methods.
    CBVs define get(), post(), put(), delete() methods.
- Error Views
    Custom views can return 404, 403, or other error responses.
    Django can also use custom error handlers: handler404, handler500, etc.
- CSRF in Views
    By default, Django requires CSRF tokens for POST methods.
    Use @csrf_exempt to bypass during testing (not recommended in production).
- Best Practices
    Keep views thin – avoid too much logic in views.
    Delegate database access to models and data formatting to templates.
    Use CBVs when you need reusability and structure.
    Use FBVs when logic is simple or highly customized.
